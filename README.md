# Timecord

Do you need to grind money in a Discord economy bot, and required to send a command every 10 minutes? If so, this is the software you need. Timecord records the last time you sent the Discord command, and will tell you when you can send the command again.

### Disclaimer

Timecord DOES NOT interact with Discord. It only detects your keystrokes and saves the information. Timecord DOES NOT and WILL NEVER automatically send commands. Timecord is basically a timer that resets every time you type something.  However, I (Timothy Huang) am not liable for anything that results from using this software.

## Download and Installation

Note: Timecord is a portable application.
